# 🧑‍💻 Web-Based Facial Authentication System (Dockerized)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **web-based facial authentication system** using a webcam and facial recognition techniques. The system captures live images from a user’s webcam, extracts facial features using **dlib-based embeddings**, and verifies identity against enrolled faces. To enhance security, **rate limiting** is applied to prevent brute-force attempts.

The application is fully **containerized using Docker (Podman compatible)** to ensure dependency isolation and system stability, especially on security-focused operating systems like **Kali Linux**.

## 🔐 Key Features
- Webcam-based facial login
- Face recognition using **dlib + face_recognition**
- Real-time image capture via browser
- Brute-force protection using rate limiting
- Dockerized deployment (no host dependency pollution)
- Privacy-aware design (biometric data excluded from GitHub)
